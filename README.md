# Anova Precision Oven Homebridge Plugin
What if making toast were as easy as pushing a single button, or, that failing, a siri command away?

This Homebridge plugin implements the [Anova Precision Oven API](https://mcolyer.github.io/anova-oven-api/#introduction) to interface with the Anova cloud service (it does not locally connect to the oven - nobody has reverse-engineered a solution for that yet).

For each oven in your account, it exposes a device with multiple switches - one that toggles power on/off, and one for each of a list of favorite recipes. Toggling a recipe on starts that recipe. 

To install: see the `config.json.example` file. Copy/paste the "AnovaToast" platform definision into your `platforms` array. To customize the favorite recipes that show up in HomeKit, tweak the `recipes` block. 

Default recipes:
* Make toast (from the recipe in the Anova app)
* Bake (350F, bottom heater, low fan)
* Sous-Vide (130F, sous-video mode)
* Air Fry (425F, rear heater)

This plugin was created based on the code in [create new repository from template](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-plugin-template/generate)

## Release notes
- Release 1.1.4: Adds a retry/reconnect loop to the websocket connection to the Anova cloud service
- Release 1.1.2: Improves latency of power on/off switch updating
- Release 1.1.1: Pushes status updates to HomeKit API as oven status changes, fixes null dereference on wet bulb temperature status
- Release 1.1.0: Support for Anova Oven Protocol Version 2
- Release 1.0.0: Initial release (supports Anova Oven Protocol Version 1 only)

## Local dev 
`npm run build && npm link && DEBUG=* homebridge -D -C -U .` (uses `config.json` in cwd)

## Protocol notes
Inspiration from [mcolyer's oven API V1 reverse engineering results](https://mcolyer.github.io/anova-oven-api/).

### Procedure:
We can man-in-the-middle the HTTPS traffic from the Anova Oven app to find out how the app communicates with the cloud service.

Service domains:
* `wss://app.oven.anovaculinary.io/` - Oven Control API (V1)
* `wss://devices.anovaculinary.io/` - Oven Control API (V2)
* `https://uh9n6t5uyo-3.algolianet.com/` - Community Recipes
* `https://firestore.googleapis.com/` - Oven activity history, saved recipes

Running a man-in-the-middle against the firebase APIs is outside of the scope of my abilities, but here is how to do it for the Anova service:
#### Deploy proxy
1. Set up mitmproxy or Proxyman
2. Start an Android emulator (any device, tested on API34)
3. In emulator, set proxy: Settings -> Wifi -> Select network/edit -> Advanced -> Proxy
4. In emulator, install proxy's SSL root CA (navigate to the install URL in browser, then Settings -> Trusted credentials -> Install a certificate -> CA Certificate -> Select the downloaded CA)

#### Repackage app to trust user CAs
Android apps can specify whether or not to trust user-installed root certificate CA's. To snoop the SSL traffic, we need to edit the app to allow this.

1. Download the most recent Anova Oven App APK (e.g. [from apkpure](https://m.apkpure.com/anova-oven/com.anovaculinary.anovaoven))
2. Use [apktool](https://apktool.org) to unwrap the apk
3. Edit the file `res/xml/network_security_config.xml`:

Before: 
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
    <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">10.0.2.2</domain>
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">192.168.4.1</domain>
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">localhost</domain>
    </domain-config>
</network-security-config>
```
After:

```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<network-security-config>
    <domain-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">10.0.2.2</domain>
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">192.168.4.1</domain>
        <domain includeSubdomains="true">localhost</domain>
    </domain-config>
     <base-config>
            <trust-anchors>
                <!-- Trust preinstalled CAs -->
                <certificates src="system" />
                <!-- Additionally trust user added CAs -->
                <certificates src="user" />
           </trust-anchors>
      </base-config>
</network-security-config>
```
4. Recompile the APK: `apktool b .` (outputs to `APKName/dist/`)
5. Sign the APK.
    1. If you do not already have a keystore setup for this: `keytool -genkey -v -keystore key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias apkfun` (the cannonical default keystore password to use is `changeit`)
    2. Sign it: `jarsigner -keystore key.jks APKName/dist/APKName.apk apkfun`
    3. Align the native libraries (you'll get some error if not): `zipalign -v 4 APKName/dist/APKName.apk`
6. Install the APK on your emulator (drag and drop the APK to the emulator)
